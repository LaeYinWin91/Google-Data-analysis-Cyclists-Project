# GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS CAPSTONE PROJECT CASE STUDY
This is Google Data Analytics Capstone Project case study. The data is collected from a fictional company. The data is downloaded from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. For data cleaning, I use Excel and SQL to clean. For data analysis, I use SQL to analyze and use Tableau to do visualization. For visualization, can follow the link. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lae.win/viz/Cyclisticsdata-Googledataanalysticsproject/Dashboard1

Findings

The number of trips are made mostly by members whereas the duration of ride time is mostly made by casual users.
Throughout the year, the number of trips is highly made around June to August by both users.
Interestingly, the usage of cyclists by members is different for day of week. Casual users use mostly on weekend when members use mostly on weekdays.
For type of bike, classic bike and electric bike are popular for both users.
Recommendation

Should do promotion campaigns for casual users to sign up for memberships from June to August.
Should focus more on classic bike and electric bike.
On the other hand, should keep promoting to attract more casual users.
